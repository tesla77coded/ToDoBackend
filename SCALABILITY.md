# Scalability Note — Todo Backend

This project is built for the internship assignment, but here are some points on how it can be scaled if needed in a real-world scenario. I’m keeping it short and simple.

---

## Quick Improvements

* **Caching:** Use Redis to cache results of `GET /tasks` so repeated requests are faster.
* **Indexes:** Add proper MongoDB indexes (on owner, status, dueDate) to improve query performance.
* **Rate Limiting:** Add middleware (like `express-rate-limit`) on login/register routes to avoid abuse.
* **Logs & Monitoring:** Send logs to a monitoring tool and add a simple `/health` endpoint to check if the service and database are up.

## Scaling the App

* **Horizontal Scaling:** Run multiple instances of the backend behind a load balancer so it can handle more users at once.
* **Database Scaling:** Use MongoDB Atlas replica sets for high availability. Add read replicas if reads increase.
* **Stateless Servers:** Since auth is handled via JWT, servers remain stateless which makes scaling easier.

---

## Future Improvements

* **Background Jobs:** Use a worker + queue (like Redis + Bull) for things that don’t need to block API responses.
* **Docker:** Containerize the backend so it can run the same way in any environment.
* **Microservices (later):** If the system grows, split services into smaller ones (Auth, Tasks, Users).

### Summary

Right now the project is simple and works fine for small scale. With caching, better DB indexing, and horizontal scaling, it can handle more load. Over time, moving to background workers, Docker, and possibly microservices would make it production-ready.
